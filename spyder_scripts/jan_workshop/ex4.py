Exercise 4

1. Write a function that returns its GC-content when a sequence is given
   GC_Content = (#G + #C) / length(seq)
2. SeqForEX4.txt contains 5 different DNA sequences with its corresponding
   headers, find a way to read in the 5 sequences alone and print them out, 
   respectively
3. Calculate the GC-content for all 5 sequences

*  Find the sequence with the highest GC-content, write its ID from header
   and its coresponding GC-content to a file named 'result.txt'
